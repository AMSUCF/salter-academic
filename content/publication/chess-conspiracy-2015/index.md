abstract: Recently, the margins between gaming and feminism have become increasingly
  contentious (Salter & Blodgett, 2012). This article addresses a cultural moment
  where masculine gaming culture became aware of and began responding to feminist
  game scholars by analyzing GamerGate conspiracy documents and social media discussions
  related to the now infamous “DiGRA fishbowl.” Worries about the opacity of academic
  practices and a disparaging of feminist knowledge-making practices dominate these
  documents. By looking at these discussions and practices through the lens of conspiracy
  theories (Fenster, 2008; Hofstadter, 1952) and counterknowledge (Fiske, 1994) we
  consider the broader meaning of GamerGate's attention to academia.
