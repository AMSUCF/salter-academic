 abstract = {In this paper, we seek to extend the definition and scope of discourse surrounding creative games and play by looking outside the communities traditionally represented in the conception of "gamer" and game studies. Through an examination of games popular in craft communities, particularly that of the textile craft spaces dominated by women, we propose a new model for merging craft play with existing representations and understanding of "craft" and craft systems as a part of gaming. Drawing upon the community-oriented, challenge-centered models we discuss in this paper, we offer potential avenues for game designers to pursue inclusive, feminist design and rethinking creative modalities of play.},
