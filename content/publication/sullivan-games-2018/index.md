abstract: In this paper, we seek to extend the definition and scope of discourse surrounding
  creative games and play by looking outside the communities traditionally represented
  in the conception of \"gamer\" and game studies. Through an examination of games
  popular in craft communities, particularly that of the textile craft spaces dominated
  by women, we propose a new model for merging craft play with existing representations
  and understanding of \"craft\" and craft systems as a part of gaming. Drawing upon
  the community-oriented, challenge-centered models we discuss in this paper, we offer
  potential avenues for game designers to pursue inclusive, feminist design and rethinking
  creative modalities of play.
