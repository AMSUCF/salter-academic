abstract: 'What Is Your Quest? examines the future of electronic literature in a world
  where tablets and e-readers are becoming as common as printed books and where fans
  are blurring the distinction between reader and author. The construction of new
  ways of storytelling is already underway: it is happening on the edges of the mainstream
  gaming industry and in the spaces between media, on the foundations set by classic
  games. Along these margins, convergent storytelling allows for playful reading and
  reading becomes a strategy of play.  One of the earliest models for this new way
  of telling stories was the adventure game, the kind of game centered on quests in
  which the characters must overcome obstacles and puzzles. After they fell out of
  fashion in the 1990s, fans made strenuous efforts to keep them alive and to create
  new games in the genre. Such activities highlight both the convergence of game and
  story and the collapsing distinction between reader and author. Continually defying
  the forces of obsolescence, fans return abandoned games to a playable state and
  treat stories as ever-evolving narratives. Similarly, players of massive multiplayer
  games become co-creators of the game experience, building characters and creating
  social networks that recombine a reading and gaming community.  The interactions
  between storytellers and readers, between programmers and creators, and among fans
  turned world-builders are essential to the development of innovative ways of telling
  stories. And at the same time that fan activities foster the convergence of digital
  gaming and storytelling, new and increasingly accessible tools and models for interactive
  narrative empower a broadening range of storytellers. It is precisely this interactivity
  among a range of users surrounding these new platforms that is radically reshaping
  both e-books and games and those who read and play with them.'
