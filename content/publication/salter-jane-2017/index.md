abstract: In the 1990s, the Personal Computer (or PC) was on the rise in homes, and
  with it came new genres of play. Yet most of the games in these new genres featured
  fantasylands or humorous science fiction landscapes with low stakes and little to
  suggest the potential of the PC as a serious space for art and play. Jane Jensen&#39;s
  work and landmark Gabriel Knight series brought a new darkness and personality to
  PC gaming, offering a first powerful glimpse of what games could be as they came
  of age. As an author and designer, Jensen brought her approach as a designer-writer
  hybrid to the forefront of game design, with an approach to developing environments
  through detailed research to make game settings come to life, an attention to mature
  dilemmas and complex character development, and an audience-driven vision for genres
  reaching beyond the typical market approaches of the gaming industry. With a brand
  new interview with Jensen herself, Anastasia Salter provides the first ever look
  Jensen&#39;s impact and role in advancing interactive narrative and writing in the
  game design process.
