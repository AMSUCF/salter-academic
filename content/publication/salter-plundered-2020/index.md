abstract: "The game genres that typically dominate the discourse of game studies,\
  \ from role-playing games with their questing heroes to simulation games with their\
  \ emphasis on settler and/or military aggression, are associated with masculinity.\
  \ Romance, when it exists at all, is a footnote that follows the same rules of conquest\
  \ and victory as other models of masculine play: princesses are rescued, lovers\
  \ are “won.” This article argues that the very decision to design romantic play\
  \ is an act of feminist game design. Its examination of Plundered Hearts, released\
  \ by Infocom in 1987 and designed by Amy Briggs, positions the contributions of\
  \ romantic play as an essential part of the history of feminist games. It traces\
  \ Briggs's contributions as a feminist designer, including her design of playable\
  \ women characters and her engagement with nontraditional methods of play in Plundered\
  \ Hearts,and contrasts her work with that of her peers."
