abstract: While queer narratives have recently gained greater prominence and attention
  [35][51][48] both in games and game studies, they still represent a tiny portion
  of the playable romances available. Even fewer among these represent the potential
  of what Edmond Chang [12] has referred to as \"queergaming,\" or games which refuse
  to conform in their narrative, mechanics, and modes of play to a cisgender, white,
  heteronormative gaze. We argue that meaningful queergaming is impossible within
  the current norms and genres of so-called AAA, or mainstream. It thus requires space
  and platforms dedicated to transgressive game design, building on Aarseth's [1]
  framework of transgressive play. To substantiate our argument, we use an examination
  of recent queer visual novels built using Ren'Py and released on Itch.io, with a
  case study of most popular current exemplar Butterfly Soup [32] alongside previous
  exemplars of queer romance in games.
